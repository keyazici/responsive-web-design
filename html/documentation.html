            This tutorial explains how to import a new project into Git, make
            changes to it, and share changes with other developers.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are instead primarily interested in using Git to fetch a
            project, for example, to test the latest version, you may prefer to
            start with the first two chapters of The Git User’s Manual.
          </li>
          <li>
            First, note that you can get documentation for a command such as git
            log --graph with:$ man git-log or:$ git help log
          </li>
          <li>
            With the latter, you can use the manual viewer of your choice; see
            git-help[1] for more information.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is a good idea to introduce yourself to Git with your name and
            public email address before doing any operation. The easiest way to
            do so is:$ git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here" $
            git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Importing_a_new_project">
        <header>Importing a new project</header>
        <p>
          Assume you have a tarball project.tar.gz with your initial work. You
          can place it under Git revision control as follows.
        </p>
        <code>$ tar xzf project.tar.gz $ cd project $ git init</code>
        <p>Git will reply</p>
        <code>Initialized empty Git repository in .git/</code>
        <p>
          You’ve now initialized the working directory—​you may notice a new
          directory created, named ".git". Next, tell Git to take a snapshot of
          the contents of all files under the current directory (note the .),
          with git add:
        </p>
        <code>$ git add .</code>
        <p>
          This snapshot is now stored in a temporary staging area which Git
          calls the "index". You can permanently store the contents of the index
          in the repository with git commit:
        </p>
        <code>$ git commit</code>
        <p>
          This will prompt you for a commit message. You’ve now stored the first
          version of your project in Git.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Making_changes">
        <header>Making changes</header>
        <p>Modify some files, then add their updated contents to the index:</p>
        <code>$ git add file1 file2 file3</code>
        <p>
          You are now ready to commit. You can see what is about to be committed
          using git diff with the --cached option:
        </p>
        <code>$ git diff --cached</code>
        <p>
          (Without --cached, git diff will show you any changes that you’ve made
          but not yet added to the index.) You can also get a brief summary of
          the situation with git status:
        </p>
        <code
          >$ git status On branch master Changes to be committed: Your branch is
          up to date with 'origin/master'. (use "git restore --staged file..."
          to unstage) modified: file1 modified: file2 modified: file3</code
        >
        <p>
          If you need to make any further adjustments, do so now, and then add
          any newly modified content to the index. Finally, commit your changes
          with:
        </p>
        <code>$ git commit</code>
        <p>
          This will again prompt you for a message describing the change, and
          then record a new version of the project. Alternatively, instead of
          running git add beforehand, you can use
        </p>
        <code>$ git commit -a</code>
        <p>
          which will automatically notice any modified (but not new) files, add
          them to the index, and commit, all in one step. A note on commit
          messages: Though not required, it’s a good idea to begin the commit
          message with a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing
          the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough
          description. The text up to the first blank line in a commit message
          is treated as the commit title, and that title is used throughout Git.
          For example, git-format-patch[1] turns a commit into email, and it
          uses the title on the Subject line and the rest of the commit in the
          body.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Git_tracks_content_not_files">
        <header>Git tracks content not files</header>
        <p>
          Many revision control systems provide an add command that tells the
          system to start tracking changes to a new file. Git’s add command does
          something simpler and more powerful: git add is used both for new and
          newly modified files, and in both cases it takes a snapshot of the
          given files and stages that content in the index, ready for inclusion
          in the next commit.

        <header>Viewing project history</header>
        <p>At any point you can view the history of your changes using</p>
        <code>$ git log</code>
        <p>If you also want to see complete diffs at each step, use</p>
        <code>$ git log -p</code>
        <p>
          Often the overview of the change is useful to get a feel of each step
        </p>
        <code>$ git log --stat --summary</code>
